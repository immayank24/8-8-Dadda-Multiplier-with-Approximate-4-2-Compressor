8Ã—8 Dadda Multiplier with Approximate 4:2 Compressor

AN 8x8 Dadda multiplier is implemented using a approximate 4:2 compressor. The steps of implementation are as follows:
1. Approximate region where approximate 4:2 compressor is used for reduction stage.
2. Recovery Region where error detection module is implemented 
3. Exact region of MSB side where exact 4:2 compressor is used.
